# exploratory-analysis-of-A-E-data
This exploratory analysis is based on a synthetic AandE dataset where there is no concern surrounding patient privacy and confidentiality.

# What was the purpose of the analysis?
The purpose of the exploratory analysis was to give a brief insight into the data, answering questions such as the missingness of the data, and using available entries for use in an equation.

One of the questions this analysis set out to answer was whether heart rate, or temperature, had a correlation with mortality. When a patient suffers from a heart condition such as a myocardial infarction (MI), the cardiac muscle dies; resulting in a significantly decreased amount of force produced by the left ventricle to propel the blood towards critical organs. The reduced blood flow results in insufficient oxygen being delivered to these organ systems, and results in a hypoxic state. THe body is excellent at adapting to such 

# Results of the analysis


# What have I learnt?
This project gave me more experience into processing the data before it can be used. Many of the tasks, such as plotting the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), contained several steps for completion. Overall, this project gave me more confidence in manipulating and processing the data.

# Challenges
One of the challenges that I have come across was attempting to plot all 1000 plots into a single image using subplots. When I attempted to do so, the plots would overlap each other. To overcome this, I could use the 'tight' plotting configuration which automatically assigns the plots a position.
